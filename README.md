# Exploring_Autism_Genes
In the first part of the project, I look at prevalence and citation data to understand how the literature on these genes has evolved and where the weight of evidence lies in the published articles. 

In the second part of the project, I perform some analysis of the genes themselves in an attempt to learn more about them. 

In the third part of the project, I carry out some basic network analysis to identify gene clusters of possible interest and use a network tool to gain some insight into the function of these gene clusters.
